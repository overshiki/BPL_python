THIS IS A PROJECT IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA OF BAYESIAN PROGRAM LEARNING OF THE PAPER 
	Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., and Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. Science, 350(6266), 1332-1338.

BASIC IDEA ARE FROM https://github.com/brendenlake/BPL WHICH IS A MATLAB IMPLMENTATION

THIS SHOULD NOT BE A DIRECT "PHOTOCOPY" OF THE MATLAB CODE IN PYTHON, INSTEAD, THIS SHOULD BE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MY OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PAPER AND THE MATLAB VERSION OF CODE
